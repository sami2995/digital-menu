# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for the React application.

## Changes Made

### Modified Files:

1. **frontend/package.json**
   - Added `@vercel/analytics` version `^1.6.1` to dependencies

2. **frontend/package-lock.json**
   - Updated lock file with @vercel/analytics package and its dependencies
   - Used `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to resolve peer dependency conflicts with TypeScript versions

3. **frontend/src/App.js**
   - Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/react";`
   - Inserted `<Analytics />` component inside the Router component, right before the Navbar
   - Placement ensures analytics tracking across all routes

## Implementation Details

- **Package Manager**: npm (detected via package-lock.json)
- **Main App File**: frontend/src/App.js (using React with react-router-dom)
- **Installation Method**: `npm install @vercel/analytics --legacy-peer-deps`
- **Component Placement**: Inside the `<Router>` component to enable tracking across all routes

## Verification

✅ **Build**: Successfully compiled production build with no errors
✅ **Linting**: No ESLint errors introduced
✅ **Dependencies**: Lock file updated correctly

## Notes

- The Analytics component is placed inside the Router wrapper to ensure proper tracking across all application routes
- Used `--legacy-peer-deps` flag during installation to resolve TypeScript peer dependency conflicts between react-scripts 5.0.1 (requires TypeScript ^4) and @vercel/analytics optional peer dependencies
- The plain React implementation does not include route-specific tracking features (as per documentation)
- Analytics will start collecting data once the application is deployed to Vercel

## Testing Note

Pre-existing test setup issue was identified (react-router-dom module resolution in jest), but this is unrelated to our changes. The production build compiles successfully, confirming that all imports are correct.
