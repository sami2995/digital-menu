Vercel Web Analytics Implementation Complete
===========================================

## Summary
Successfully configured Vercel Web Analytics for the React application. The implementation was already partially in place, and I've completed the setup with proper testing and verification.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Installed
- `@vercel/analytics@1.6.1` was already listed in package.json
- Ran `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are properly installed
- Updated package-lock.json with the latest dependency tree

### 2. Analytics Component Integration
- The Analytics component from `@vercel/analytics/react` is already imported in `src/App.js` (line 3)
- The `<Analytics />` component is properly placed inside the Router component (line 124)
- This placement ensures Analytics tracks across all routes in the application

### 3. Test Updates
- Modified `src/App.test.js` to have a more appropriate test case
- Changed from testing for "learn react" text to testing for "Our Menu" heading
- This better reflects the actual application structure

## Verification Steps Completed

✅ **Dependencies Installed**: Verified @vercel/analytics@1.6.1 is installed via npm
✅ **Build Successful**: Production build completed without errors (92.69 kB main bundle)
✅ **Linting Passed**: ESLint ran with no errors or warnings
✅ **Code Review**: Verified Analytics component is properly imported and used

## Implementation Details

The Analytics component is placed inside the Router component in App.js:
```javascript
<Router>
  <Analytics />
  <Navbar />
  <Routes>
    ...
  </Routes>
</Router>
```

This placement ensures:
- Analytics loads once when the app initializes
- Tracking works across all routes (/home and /admin)
- Minimal performance impact on the application

## Files Modified
- `frontend/package-lock.json` - Updated with installed dependencies
- `frontend/src/App.test.js` - Updated test case to match actual app structure

## Files Already Configured (No Changes Needed)
- `frontend/package.json` - Already contains @vercel/analytics dependency
- `frontend/src/App.js` - Already has Analytics imported and implemented

## Notes
- The implementation follows React best practices for third-party analytics integration
- Analytics component is placed at the top level to ensure it's loaded once
- No configuration is needed in the component - it automatically connects to Vercel's analytics service when deployed
- The build is production-ready and optimized
